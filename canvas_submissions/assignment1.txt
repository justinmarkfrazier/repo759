1)

I went through a) through c) and understand how to time code, how to submit my assignments with git, and what the recommended workflow is when it comes to working on myt assignment




2)

a.

cd somedir

b.

cat sometext.txt

c.

tail -n 5 sometext.txt

d.

tail -n 5 *.txt

e.

for i in {0..6}
do
echo "$i"
done




3)

a.

No

b.

gcc/12.2.0, gcc/13.2.0, and gcc/14.3.0 are all available

c.

    list of available cuda modules:
nvidia/cuda/10.2.2
nvidia/cuda/11.8.0
nvidia/cuda/12.5.0
nvidia/nvhpc-hpcx-cuda12/23.11
nvidia/cuda/11.0.3
nvidia/cuda/12.0.0
nvidia/cuda/12.9.1
nvidia/nvhpc-hpcx-cuda12/24.5  (D)
nvidia/cuda/11.3.1
nvidia/cuda/12.1.0
nvidia/cuda/13.0.0            (D)
nvidia/cuda/11.6.0
nvidia/cuda/12.2.0
nvidia/nvhpc-hpcx-cuda11/24.5

d.

matlab/r2023a is the module for the 2023 release of MATLAB, which is a computing environment and high-level programming language well suited for engineering applications.




5)

a.

The job starts out in the directory the submit script lies in, which in this case is /srv/home/jmfrazier2/repo759/HW01

b.

SLURM_JOB_ID is an environment variable that is equal to the numeric job identifier Slurm assigns to the job

c.

I would type "squeue -u jmfrazier2" in bash which would list all my queued and currently running jobs

d.

I would type "scancel [job_id]" in bash where job_id is the Slurm

e.

That header requests a single GPU be allocated for the Slurm job

f.

That header requests that an array of jobs (each with a unique job identifier) be submitted according to the instructions in the batch submission script, which may involve slight changes in parameters or files for each job

I filled out the survey
