mmul2 is much faster than mmul1 because the inner loop in mmul1 is k, so there are jumps in
the row-major stored memory of the array B[k * n + j], whereas in mmul2 the inner loop is over j,
which leads to good locality for B[k * n + j] and C[i * n + j]. mmul3 is much slower than mmul1
because the inner loop is over i, which means A[i * n + k] and C[i * n + j] both have bad locality.
mmul4 is about the same speed as mmul1 because it uses the same loop order, so the variable type 
is not the dominant effect on program speed in this case and is instead dominated by memory access.
